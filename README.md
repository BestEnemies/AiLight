# AiLight
AiLight is a simple library to control an AiLight that contains the MY9291 LED driver. The Ai-Light is an inexpensive WiFi RGBW LED bulb based on the ESP8266 MCU. 

Xose Pérez has wrote an excellent [article](http://tinkerman.cat/ailight-hackable-rgbw-light-bulb/) on his blog how you can upload your own firmware to this bulb. Please note this requires a little bit of soldering :).

Using the AiLight library is very straightforward and simple. Include this AiLight library in your project: an instance named 'AiLight' is already available to control the light.

Example: TBD

Making this library was inspired by the [MY9291](https://github.com/xoseperez/my9291) LED driver of [Xose Pérez](https://github.com/xoseperez).

# Disclaimer

This library is designed for the ESP8266 and AVR device only. Other [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) are not supported.


# Dependencies

This library makes use of the [MY9291](https://github.com/xoseperez/my9291) LED driver. You need to add it to use this AiLight library.
