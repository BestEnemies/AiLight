[0.2.0-alpha]# - 2017-04-27
After two weeks of hacking and modding, a first Alpha release is ready! The AiLight firmware allows you via WiFi to:
- switch the light on or off
- set the level of the 4 colour channels (Red, Green, Blue and White)
- set the brightness level
- set the light at a particular colour temperature
- let the light flash (with a defined colour and brightness)
- after powering on the light again, the last known settings are remembered (colour, brightness, etc.)
This can all be done in HomeAssistant (using the MQTT integration) or the built in (mobile friendly) UI.

[0.1.0] - 2017-04-21
Initial Release of the AiLight: AiLight is a simple library to control an AiLight that contains the MY9291 LED driver.
